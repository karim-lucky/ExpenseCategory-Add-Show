This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Setup
Install Dependencies:

Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

bash
Copy code
npm install axios moment react-hook-form react-toastify
or

bash
Copy code
yarn add axios moment react-hook-form react-toastify
File Structure:

Ensure that your project structure matches the paths used in the import statements. For example, the MyTab component should be located in ../../components/tab/tabs.

Styling:

Include the CSS file categoryShow.css in your project for styling. Adjust the styles as needed based on your design requirements.

API Endpoints:

The component interacts with the following API endpoints:

GET /api/category: Fetches the list of categories.
PUT /api/expense: Updates an existing expense.
DELETE /api/expense: Deletes an expense.
Ensure that these endpoints are implemented on your server.

Usage
Import and Use the Component:

Import the CategoryShow component into your React application and use it as follows:

jsx
Copy code
import CategoryShow from './path/to/CategoryShow';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <CategoryShow />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Interaction:

View Categories: Click on a category to view its associated expenses.
Filter by Date: Use the date range filters to sort categories or expenses.
Edit Expenses: Click on the "Edit" button in the dropdown menu for an expense to open a modal. Modify the expense details in the modal and save changes.
Delete Expenses: Click on the "Delete" button in the dropdown menu for an expense to remove it.
Modal for Editing Expenses:

The component includes a modal for updating expenses. Ensure that your project includes Bootstrap or a similar library to handle modals. The modal provides a form to update the expense details including date, category, note, and amount.

Troubleshooting
API Errors: Check the browser console for errors related to API requests. Ensure the backend services are operational.
Styling Issues: Confirm that the CSS file is correctly loaded and applied.
Modal Issues: Ensure that the modal functionality works correctly with Bootstrap or the modal library you are using.
